JPEG Utilities.

There are several utilities in this package.  To run them, you need to use this commandline:

java com.elf.graphics.UTILITY_NAME arguments

You also need to have elf.jar in your classpath.  E.g. if you put the jar file in C:\MyClasses, your CLASSPATH can be set like so:

set CLASSPATH=C:\MyClasses\elf.jar	(add this line to c:\autoexec.bat)

------------------

To make it a little esier, I've enclose some batch files:

elfg.bat --> this handles the "java com.elf.graphics." part of the commandline.
EXAMPLES:

elfg JPEGCleaner c:\bad_art c:\fixed_art
elfg JPEGInfo c:\porn\eating_shit\robs_favorite_feces.jpg

---------------------------------------------
JClean -- this will clean-up all the jpeg and gif files in the current directory, and place the fixed copies in a new subdirectory called fixed
the actual commandline is "java com.elf.graphics.JPEGCleaner . fixed"

===================================================

UTILITIES:

JPEGCleaner
JPEGInfo
JPEGResizer

just run any of them with no arguments to get help on using them 

e.g.   

elfg JPEGResizer 

=============================================

If you like it and use them a lot, I'll dick around and add a GUI to make it easier to use them!
