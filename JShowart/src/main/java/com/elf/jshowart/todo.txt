*************   BUGS  *******************

BUG:  View/fit to screen ^T doesn't work until View menu is selected! Seems to be fixed?!?
Window positioning on startup.  If it was maximized on second monitor it will startup maximized on first monitor - probably not worth the effort to fix
*********************************************
TODO:

KeyDialog - calculate initial size based on #rows
KeyCommands -- don't allow any 'builtins'  e.g. ctrl-shift-R, space, etc
in KeyDialogTablePanel -- don't use hard-coded numbers for columns.  Do a getColumn with the name
in KeyCommand -- have the correct item selected when combo box for key is dropped down
CLEANUP the setEnable calls to menuitems.  Centralize them based on call to Model.replace()
Organize the file ext filters into one place
Add a UI for setting slideshow time
Info Dialog
Kludgy code saving key commands
*****************   FINISHED ITEMS   **********************
Key Commands - don't allow duplicates (in UserPrefs?) 
BUG: check location from prefs and make sure it isn't off-screen!  E.g. going from 2 monitors to 1
Put one JFileChooser in globals for save and open ???
BUG: Don't allow "save current size as" when scaling (makes no sense?)
File Extensions: tif jpg tiff bmp gif png jpeg wbmp  Add a seperate FileNameExtensionFilter for each image type?
FIXED BUG(?) save as - don't enter a file extension - automatically add one!
Figure out a clean way to disable menu items dynamically e.g. SaveAsNow
keylistener added inside View ctor --> used KeyHandler class instead
SAVE the JFileChooser in view instead of creating a new one each time
right arrow, left arrow
name of file in title bar
Use ONE open dialog for directories AND files?!?
SAVE the JFileChooser in frame instead of creating a new one each time
XX Save scaled -->
MenuSaveThisSizeActionPerformed - get rid of it
Does windows size get saved correctly when  maximized?
