*************   BUGS  *******************
BUG(?) save as - don't enter a file extension - automatically add one!
MenuSaveThisSizeActionPerformed - get rid of it
*********************************************
keylistener added inside View ctor
Figure out a clean way to disable menu items dynamically e.g. SaveAsNow
File Extensions: tif jpg tiff bmp gif png jpeg wbmp  Add a seperate FileNameExtensionFilter for each image type?
Organize the file ext filters into one place
SAVE the JFileChooser in view instead of creating a new one each time
BUG: check location from prefs and make sure it isn't off-screen!  E.g. going from 2 monitors to 1
Put one JFileChooser in globals for save and open ???
