*************   BUGS  *******************
BUG(?) save as - don't enter a file extension - automatically add one!
MenuSaveThisSizeActionPerformed - get rid of it
Does windows size get saved correctly when  maximized? 
*********************************************
File Extensions: tif jpg tiff bmp gif png jpeg wbmp  Add a seperate FileNameExtensionFilter for each image type?
Organize the file ext filters into one place
BUG: check location from prefs and make sure it isn't off-screen!  E.g. going from 2 monitors to 1
Put one JFileChooser in globals for save and open ???
Add a UI for setting slideshow time
*****************   FINISHED ITEMS   **********************
Figure out a clean way to disable menu items dynamically e.g. SaveAsNow
keylistener added inside View ctor --> used KeyHandler class instead
SAVE the JFileChooser in view instead of creating a new one each time
right arrow, left arrow
name of file in title bar
Use ONE open dialog for directories AND files?!?
SAVE the JFileChooser in frame instead of creating a new one each time

XX Save scaled -->
Info Dialog
